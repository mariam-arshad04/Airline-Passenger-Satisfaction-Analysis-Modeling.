# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Analysis-Modeling.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a U.S. airline passenger satisfaction survey to identify the key factors influencing customer satisfaction. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using percentage-based visualizations to uncover patterns across demographics, travel class, service quality, and flight delays.

A machine learning model (XGBoost) was developed to predict passenger satisfaction, and SHAP was used to explain feature impacts, clearly showing which factors influence satisfaction positively or negatively. The findings were converted into actionable business insights and recommendations to improve customer experience and operational performance.
